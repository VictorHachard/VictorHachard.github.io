## keyboard sizes

![seven-layers-OSI-model]({{site.baseurl}}/res/keyboard/keyboard-size.png)

-   Full-sized: You usually can’t find this size for custom keyboards, it’s only used on pre-built keyboards. If you’re lucky you might be able to find a full-sized custom keyboard.

-   1800-Compact (96%): A super cool layout size that axes the navigational cluster and smushes the number pad with the rest of the keys. You can only find this size through group buys.
Tenkeyless: A common layout that chops off the number pad but still keeps the rest of the keyboard layout.

-   75%: Similar to tenkeyless, except the navigational cluster is placed vertically to save space. Fun and comfortable to use.

-   65%: This layout removes the function row and keeps some of the navigational cluster. It’s also the smallest keyboard size that keeps the dedicated arrow keys.

-   60%: The most common custom keyboard layout. There is no function row, arrow keys, or navigational cluster. You can find parts a 60% the easiest.

-   40%: The smallest size that you can still type on. It’s basically a 60% keyboard except you remove the numeric keys. You’ll need to get used to typing on different layers to use this size. A very long adjustment period is required for a 40% layout.

-   Macropad: Basically, a separate number pad that you can assign macros to. Very fun to use alongside your main keyboard.

-   PCB (printed circuit board): The PCB is lifeblood of your keyboard. It’s the brain and the central unit. The PCB you choose determines the size, features, and layout of your keyboard. Choose wisely.

-   Case: The case is what hold everything together and protects it from the elements. You can choose different case materials depending on how durable, aesthetic, or see-through you want your keyboard to be.

-   Plate: The plate is an optional component, but it holds the switches in place and adds rigidity to the overall build. Definitely recommended. There are different materials and color choices.

-   Stabilizers: The stabilizers determine how the larger keys will feel and sound when using the keyboard. Don’t overlook this component, they are incredibly important.

-   Switches: The switches are crucial for customizing the feel and sound of your keyboard. There are so many different switch types out there but they are mostly broken down into three different categories: linear, clicky, and tactile.

-   Keycaps: This part really sets the aesthetic for your board. When you sit down to type, you’ll be interacting with the keycaps the most. The profile, design, and durability of the keycaps is really important.
