Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. It allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.
