## What are complete second-degree equations

The complete second degree equations or quadratic equations are represented as follows:

<img src="https://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/ax%5E2%2Bbx%2Bc%3D0" alt="ax^2+bx+c=0" />

Where a, b and c are the constants of the equation:

- a is the number that always goes in front of x squared
- b is the number that always goes in front of the x
- c is the number without unknow


## How to solve complete second degree equations

Calculate the discriminant which is equal to

<img src="https://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/delta%20%3D%20b%5E2%20-%204ac" alt="delta = b^2 - 4ac" />

The sign of the discriminant makes it possible to distinguish 3 cases:

- If the discriminant is negative, then the equation does not admit ANY real solution, the set of real solutions is therefore the empty set.

- If the discriminant is equal to zero, then the equation only admits a real solution equal to

- If the discriminant D is positive, then the equation admits two real solutions equal to <img src="https://tex.s2cms.ru/svg/x_%7B1%2C2%7D%20%3D%20%7B-b%5Cpm%5Csqrt%7Bb%5E2%20-%204ac%7D%20%5Cover%202a%7D" alt="x_{1,2} = {-b\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}" />
