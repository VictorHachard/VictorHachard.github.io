## Initial Barebone Infrastructure

The project began with setting up a minimal barebone infrastructure on a virtual machine (VM). This foundational work established a robust environment where initial deployments were pushed, paving the way for further optimizations.

## Docker Implementation and Optimization

To enhance scalability, consistency, and ease of deployment, I integrated Docker into our infrastructure. Below is a recap of the Docker initiatives, along with the guides I authored:

- [Odoo Meet Docker](https://victorhachard.github.io/notes/odoo-meet-docker)  
  An introductory guide on integrating Docker with Odoo to streamline deployments.

- [Odoo 11 Dockerfile](https://victorhachard.github.io/notes/odoo-11-dockerfile)  
  Detailed instructions for creating a Dockerfile tailored for Odoo 11, emphasizing best practices.

- [Odoo 15 Dockerfile](https://victorhachard.github.io/notes/odoo-15-dockerfile)  
  A comprehensive guide to building a Dockerfile for Odoo 15, ensuring optimal configuration.

- [Odoo 16 Dockerfile](https://victorhachard.github.io/notes/odoo-16-dockerfile)  
  Step-by-step directions for setting up a Dockerfile for Odoo 16 with an emphasis on reliability.

- [Odoo Docker Entrypoint](https://victorhachard.github.io/notes/odoo-docker-entrypoint)  
  Guidance on customizing the Docker entrypoint to manage initialization and runtime operations effectively.

- [Odoo Add Sequence Logger](https://victorhachard.github.io/notes/odoo-add-seq-logger)  
  A guide focused on enhancing logging within Docker containers to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

- [Build & Push Docker Image with GitHub Action](https://victorhachard.github.io/notes/build-push-docker-image-with-github-action)  
  Instructions for automating the Docker image build and push process using GitHub Actions, integrating continuous integration into our workflow.

- [Build & Push Docker Image with DevOps Pipeline](https://victorhachard.github.io/notes/build-push-docker-image-with-devops-pipeline)  
  A detailed walkthrough of incorporating Docker image management into a comprehensive DevOps pipeline for seamless deployment.

## Conclusion

By transitioning from a barebone VM setup to a fully containerized infrastructure using Docker, I significantly improved deployment efficiency, system scalability, and overall operational reliability. The guides I authored serve as detailed roadmaps for each step of this transformation, providing practical insights and best practices for leveraging Docker in complex IT environments.
