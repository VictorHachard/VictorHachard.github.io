As part of my commitment to contributing to the open-source community, I developed a suite of free Odoo modules to enhance user experience and streamline ERP processes. The project includes:

- **Cron Visualization**: Visualizes the cron jobs running in your Odoo instance.
- **Enhanced Security Custom Search**: Manages access to custom filters, groupings, and shared favorites via user groups.
- **Batch Record Import/Export with Template**: Enables batch import/export of records using a predefined template.
- **Web Widget Image Field**: Adds a widget on relational fields to display an image, such as a user avatar.
- **Mermaid Widget Field**: Integrates Mermaid.js to display diagrams in Odoo views.
- **Purchase, Sale & Stock Flowcharts**: Provides visual flowcharts for purchase, sale, and stock processes.

Browse the modules on the Odoo Apps Store: [Odoo Apps](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/browse?repo_maintainer_id=554703).
