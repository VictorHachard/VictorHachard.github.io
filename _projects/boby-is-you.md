As part of the first year of the bachelor's degree in Computer Science, a project of programming must be done. This project is a video game that must be inspired by [Baba Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/). The goal is to make this video game based on the courses taught and to apply fundamental notions such as inheritance and object-oriented programming. If you want more information I invite you to read the [report](https://github.com/VictorHachard/BobyIsYou/blob/master/BobyIsYou.pdf).

Boby Is You is a small game copy of [Baba Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/). Baba Is You is an award-winning puzzle game where you can change the rules by which you play. In every level, the rules themselves are present as blocks you can interact with; by manipulating them, you can change how the level works and cause surprising, unexpected interactions! With some simple block-pushing you can turn yourself into a rock, turn patches of grass into dangerously hot obstacles, and even change the goal you need to reach to something entirely different.
