All things start with a "Hello World".

To a programmer this means specifically:

```py
def main():
  print 'Hello, world!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

But in general it should represent the minimal effort to show the workings of a
system's dependencies.

This post is my "Hello World" for all the future project I may do.
