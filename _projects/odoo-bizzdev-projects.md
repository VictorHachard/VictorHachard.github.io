Over the past four years at BizzDev, I have delivered multiple projects using Odoo Community Edition (CE) across versions 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, and 18, tailoring solutions to meet a wide range of business needs. Below are some key projects:

- **Comprehensive ERP Solution (Odoo 15)**  
  I implemented an integrated system covering Inventory, POS, eCommerce, Sales, Purchases, Invoicing, and HR. The project included extensive customizations such as specialized stock management, bulk product imports with complex supplier integrations, and dynamic price lists computed from multiple data sources and rules. I also developed a mobile app for inventory management, empowering warehouse staff with real-time data and seamless operational control.

- **B2B Auction Platform (Odoo 16)**  
  I developed and integrated an auction website within Odoo specifically for B2B clients. The platform facilitates efficient and secure online bidding by connecting to an API that retrieves customer and product data, while also providing real-time sales information for accurate tracking and robust post-auction analysis.

- **REST API Integration and Subscription System (Odoo 16)**  
  I created a robust REST API that positions Odoo as the master data source, enabling seamless communication and data exchange with external systems. Additionally, I developed powerful SQL reporting features to analyze and forecast subscription sales, and built a comprehensive subscription system with integrated payment processing using Mollie for recurring revenue.

- **Advanced Timesheet and Invoicing System (Odoo 16)**  
  I designed a timesheet management solution for a manufacturing environment that incorporates kiosk integrations to accurately track employee hours and machine usage. This system improved project tracking and streamlined invoicing based on real-time data.

- **Hotel Room Rental Module (Odoo 13)**  
  I developed a module for managing hotel room bookings, which optimizes room allocation and rental processes for enhanced operational efficiency.

- **Construction Industry Workflow Integration (Odoo 16)**  
  I implemented a solution that connects Odoo with Excel-based workflows tailored for the construction sector. This project enabled invoicing to be segmented by construction phase, ensuring detailed follow-up and accurate financial tracking.

- **Non-Profit Animal Care Management (Odoo 18)**  
  I developed a module for a non-profit organization supporting disabled individuals. This solution streamlines workflows for managing multiple dogs, handles service requests, stores comprehensive reports, and integrates a calendar for scheduling and planning activities.
